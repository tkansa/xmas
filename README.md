# Assessment 3 Practice
For this practice assessment, you are given starter CSS, HTML, and JS. You job is to complete the `scripts.js` file.

Open `script.js`, and implement the instructions in the comments

The end goal is that when you click the Christmas Tree, it will add `<div>`s with the class `present` into the `presents` div.

When you click on an indivdual present, then that div should be deleted from the DOM.
